## 📌 Projects
### **Gurobi Code Repair Agent**
An agent that automatically locates and fixes bugs in Gurobi optimization scripts using tool-based reasoning, static analysis, and iterative self-checking.

### **Lean4 Autoformalization Agent**
A pipeline that translates natural-language math statements to Lean4 code, verifies correctness via theorem checking, and uses REPL feedback for iterative refinement.

More projects soon.
